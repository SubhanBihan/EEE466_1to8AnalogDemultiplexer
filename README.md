# 1 to 8 Analogue Demultiplexer
Analog demultiplexers are also used in applications where a single analog signal needs to be routed to multiple devices.
In this project we performed a transistor-level (NMOS and CMOS) design of a 1-to-8 Analogue Demultiplexer using Cadence Virtuoso.
We also analused various metric such a power, speed, and bandwidth.
The circuit parameters were then tuned (in a feedback process) to optimise these metrics.
